## Physical Description

Lazarus Overlook is a leaf-nosed bat whose primary coat shimmers in deep crimson. Rich rosewood colors his thick neck fluff, eyebrows, and extremities, with distinctive spots of the same hue encircling his left eye. His characteristic leaf nose glows a vivid syracuse orange, matching both his striking eyes, mouth, and the interior of his large ears.

Licorice-colored fur sweeps across his right forearm and left ear, dissolving back into his crimson coat. Throughout this darker fur, target symbols stand out boldly - their rims gleaming orange, their centers a deep licorice, and their bulls-eyes burning crimson.

Though short in stature, Lazarus's sinewy frame exudes resilience. His lean muscles wrap tightly around his thin body, granting him both strength and agility in his movements. He typically dresses in luxury burgundy attire, favoring either a crisp bellhop suit or refined dark academia garments, always complemented by his signature circular glasses.
