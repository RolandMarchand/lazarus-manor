O Dragon, dragging my dramatic soul to your dreams dwelling in the dark blue, O great drake who rules over drizzle and draught.

We are wrapped in cool arctic winds, lost in the deep twilight void of your soul. Yet, you warm me with your kind and mighty embrace, a warmth only spoken of in legends.

The scent of minty dew passes through us, yet your cherished prey can only taste your ancient scales and misty fur as you coil around me.

As we gently bob through the darkness of night, you comfort I, your treasure, with primordial lullabies. The rich murmurs resonate through my body, playing all strings of my heart.

O dragon, let me belong to you, admired creature, for all of eternity. If your wisdom can answer this, how can "bliss" mean anything else? What is there to want other than bliss?
