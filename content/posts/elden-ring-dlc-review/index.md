Elden Ring is probably the video game that has impacted me the most as a person. I have a complicated relationship with the game, and I cannot think of a more deep and nuanced experience.

I did not enjoy my first playthrough. Exploring the open world felt confusing and disorienting, my ignorance of the lore made the world feel meaningless, not understanding the boss movesets made me feel self conscious, my boss kills felt dirty and unsatisfying as I finished with no more flasks, I did not know how to effectively use any weapon, skill or spell, I often wasted my time in shitty dungeons with rehashed bosses and meagre rewards, I played this huge game way too much and felt burned out, became impatient and lost the sight of what made this game great...

I did not have much positive to say about Elden Ring after my first playthrough, but I was fully aware that wasn't the game's fault, but rather how I interacted with it. I knew I would enjoy the game to its full potential I knew where to go, learned the lore, solved the puzzles that are this game's bosses, sharpened my skill, learned the hidden mechanics and strategies, only completed dungeons I knew I liked or were worth it, and took my time to smell the roses.

After more than a thousand hours, 50+ completions, and countless hours of Elden Ring lore, builds, and challenge videos watched, I can confirm that I was right. Although, I still have this feeling of missing out, and I am learning new things every playthrough that make me enjoy the game even more.

Discovering this game felt like discovering a person. It taught me so much about myself, about writing and game design. It inspired me to pursue creative activities, and made me realise that many more games could be enjoyed this way. Elden Ring taught me to appreciate art, and the world.

My love for this game developed with time, it grew on me. It's now a core part of my imaginary. It was an experience I will never forget.

So it is with a heavy heart I say I did not enjoy the DLC, but unlike with the base game, I do not wish to play it again and and I do not feel I am missing out. It feels tragic and disappointing. I do not get to enjoy what could have been the best artistic experience of my life.

There is no reason for your character to play this DLC. By the time you enter the Land of Shadow, they are expected to already be level 150 (characters do not get much stronger past this point), and have a solid build with a maxed out weapon. As a result, runes are useless, and so are upgrade materials, crafting materials, weapons, and armor. Exploring the Land of Shadow feels like taking a school class you have already graduated from. This makes exploring the open world and defeating bosses and enemies feel incredibly demotivating.

The game tries to address this problem with a new leveling system proper to the Lands Between with the Scadu Fragments. They increase your player's attacks and defences by approximately half when all collected, and there is a similar mechanic for spirit ashes with Revered Spirit Ashes. This is a band aid fix. I played through the entire DLC with only a single reward I was looking for. The vast majority of times I had my hopes up an item would be a Scadu Fragment, I was let down.
