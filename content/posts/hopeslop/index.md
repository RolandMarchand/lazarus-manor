Hopeslop is a musical genre characterized by lyrics that are meaningless and hopeful. These songs prioritize upbeat sentiment over narrative substance, creating abstract but meaningless expressions of positivity.

## Characteristics of Hopeslop Lyrics

- Minimal or no scene setting
- Minimal or no characters
- No context needed to appreciate the song
- Lines can be swapped or removed with no impact on the meaning of the song
- Most common in TV show opening/endings for children and upbeat summer pop
- Almost completely abstract
- Naive optimistic themes

## Examples of Hopeslop Songs

- ["Dreams of Our Generation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhhoPxCWZeg) (Rhythm Heaven)
- ["Gotta Catch 'Em All"](https://youtu.be/6xKWiCMKKJg?si=VZMLGQUjiCpPBczJ) (Pok√©mon theme)
- ["Happy"](https://youtu.be/ZbZSe6N_BXs?si=X5DCzCYUf0NCvZmu) by Pharrell Williams

- ["Cha-La Head Cha-La"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OyWMUaRsUc) (English version, Dragon Ball Z)

## Instrumental Hopeslop

While most hopeslop has lyrics, they are not required. Instrumental hopeslop is a sub-category of hopeslop and captures that same one-note optimism.

### Characteristics of Instrumental Hopeslop

- Simple composition with few tracks
- One-note optimism, relentlessly upbeat without variation
- Often loopable since there is no meaningful variation in moods
- Best example: [Nyan Cat theme](https://youtu.be/2yJgwwDcgV8?si=oR6Pkb0kG1xep48c)

## The Value of Hopeslop

Hopeslop isn't inherently bad music. It's effecive in mood boards and can become meaningful when paired with context. For example, "Dreams of Our Generation" from Rhythm Heaven contains the line: "you and I've been through a lot together." While this line is textbook hopeslop, it feels meaningful to the player because the game portrays itself as a rhythm training experience. It starts with a rhythm test that the players doesn't do well in, and ends with the player having mastered muscle memory for most of the games. This journey is reflected in this line.

## Beware of Faux Hopeslop

Sometimes, songs may check many boxes of hopeslop but still not qualify as such. For example, "Love Like You," the end credits song of Steven Universe has no scene setting, requires no context to understand, verses can be swapped or deleted, is an outro song of a children's TV show, and is abstract. However, the song establishes a complex relationship between the singer and its subject, and the song is imbued with complex emotions of melancholy and  bittersweetness.

Another song that sounds like hopeslop but isn't would be "Come Along With Me," the end credits song of Adventure Time. It ticks similar boxes to Steven Universe's end credits song, although it swaps complex character dynamics for a vibrant setting, and the melancholic feelings for care-free youth and freedom. 

## Conclusion

Hopeslop highlights how not all songs are given the same depth, and that's okay. What songs would you consider hopeslop? Do you find value in abstract and shallow music?
