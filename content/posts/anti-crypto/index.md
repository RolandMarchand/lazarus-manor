title: Why I Left Cryptocurrency
summary: My thoughts on the current state of crypto and why I will no longer partake in it.
description: I ceased to hold crypto because it is no longer truly decentralized. Exchanges have become the primary means of trading, and most of them don’t provide private keys, meaning you don’t actually own your crypto. Moreover, a decade after its creation, crypto is still largely used as an investment instead of as a currency. Since it’s not being used for its original purpose, I no longer believe in it.

I have invested in crypto since 2019, holding *BTC*, *BCH*, *LTC*, *XRP*, *ETH*, and *XMR*. I ceased to hold crypto a few months ago with the past five years having left no impact on my finances.

If you're considering high-risk investments, it’s better to talk to your bank rather than diving into crypto. The only real use for crypto is as a currency. For example, I often purchase art from Russian artists, and sending them money can be difficult and expensive. For this, I recommend using a coin with low exchange fees, like *BCH*.
