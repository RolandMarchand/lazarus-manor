In this post, I will present my outline template for designing compelling and well-structured narratives.

The process of writing can be divided into three major steps: outlining, writing, and editing. From those three, outlining is the most important step because ...

# Story Outline Template

## SPOOC
SPOOC is a 2 sentences template to test your story's fundamentals, to assure yourself that it is sturdy enough to last a book The first sentence establishes the situation, and the second turns the central story goal into a question
- Situation
- Protagonist
- Objective
- Opponent
- Climax

### Example
- Situation: when he is approached by Gandalf
- Protagonist: Frodo
- Objective: is tasked with destroying the One Ring. But can he throw it in Mount Doom when
- Opponent: Sauron
- Climax: tempts Frodo with the ring's power, risking the Middle-earth's fate?

## Characters
Which characters are part of the scene? (link character sheets)

## Conflict Scene
- How long is the length of the scene?

### Parts

#### Introduction
- Who is the protagonist?
- What is his goal and motivation?
- How is it established? (through dialogue, actions, or both?)
- What are the stakes?
- What is going on?
- Who are the players?
- What is the locale?
- What is the mood?

##### Viewpoint
Which type of viewpoint is used?
- [ ] First person

	Easy for the writer to write and for the readers to understand. Most intimate viewpoint. Difficult to plot for.

- [ ] Second person

	Provides no advantages, and destroys the suspension of disblief

- [ ] Third person

	Most common, easiest to write, flexible

- [ ] Omniscient

	Provides a quick insight into several characters, but it is the hardest to write and nobody does it well. Thus, it is seldom used.

##### Example of Hooks
How is the reader hooked in the scene?
- [ ] Raise a question to pique the reader's curiosity
- [ ] Introduce a vivid character
- [ ] Unexpected event
- [ ] Immediate danger
- [ ] Sinister atmosphere (best used at beginning of chapters)
- [ ] Leaping into action

#### Development
- Is adversity present? (bad luck for the protagonist)
- Who is the antagonist?
- What is his story goal and motivation?
- How do they conflict with the protagonist's?

##### Conflict Type
- [ ] combat
- [ ] verbal disagreement
- [ ] interrogation
- [ ] evasion
- [ ] bickering

#### Twist
Twists heighten the stakes and render the outcome of the scene uncertain, and can help in advancing the story. This results in increased reader engagement.

#### Resolution
- In what way does the protagonist fail his goal?
- In what way does the protagonist struggle and grow?
- What is the story outcome?
	 1. [ ] Yes, the protagonist achieves his goal (reserved for antagonist's viewpoint or plot endings)
	 2. [ ] No, the protagonist is back where they started
	 3. [ ] Yes, but things are now way worse for the protagonist
	 4. [ ] Yes, but the progress is slight and the protagonist is more doubtful
	 5. [ ] No, it is a disaster
- How will this impact the protagonist's situation?
- Which main story goal options have been removed?

### Checklist
- [ ] is there a hook at the very beginning?
- [ ] are there smaller hooks peppered throughout the scene?
- [ ] is the viewpoint clear?
- [ ] does the viewpoint remain static?
- [ ] is there a scene goal all throughout the scene?
- [ ] is the scene goal clear?
- [ ] is there only one major scene goal?
- [ ] is the protagonist active and proactive?
- [ ] is the antagonist present early?
- [ ] are the 5W1H clear? (when, where, what, who, why, how)
- [ ] Are the stakes high?
- [ ] is the outcome not determined by luck or fate?
- [ ] is the protagonist capable of resolving the conflict? (is it not hopeless from the start?)
- [ ] does the scene end in at least partial failure for the protagonist? (N/A for climax)

## Sequel
There must be another scene to asses the results and consequences of a conflict scene, and to process a character's feelings, emotions, and thoughts. This scene is called a sequel (to not confuse with another opus of a series). The sequel should also let the protagonist review the events that occurred and formulate a new story plan. The sequel can be deferred for better pacing and emotional impact, but it must happen at some point. Its length can be from just a few lines long to an entire chapter.
- How long is the length of the sequel?
- How is the sequel linked to the surrounding scenes?

### Components (in written order)
- What is the emotional aftermath?
- What is the analysis of the problem?
- What recent events just occurred?
- Which options does the protagonist have to achieve his story goal?
- What is the protagonist's decision?

### Checklist
- [ ] is the sequel proceeding a scene?
- [ ] is the sequel's length different from the majority of the others'?
- [ ] does the emotional intensity match the conflict and its stepback?
- [ ] do the protagonist's emotions create empathy for readers?
- [ ] are the protagonist's emotions vividly described? (sensory details, body language, internal monologue, dialogue, metaphor/similes)
- [ ] are important story elements mentioned?
- [ ] is the protagonist's story goal mentioned?
- [ ] does the protagonist's decision make sense considering their resources and environment?
- [ ] will the protagonist's decision result in further conflict?
