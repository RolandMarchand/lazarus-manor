In this post, I will present the outline template I use for designing compelling and well-structured narratives.

Outlining is a crucial step of the writing pipeline, which can be divided into three major steps: outlining, writing, and editing. Without a solid outline, the writing process will slow down to a crawl and insecurities will creep in as you progress through the chapters. Your story won't be cohesive and your characters will meander around. You will have wished you outlined beforehand. If you somehow get through the gruelling writing process, editing will surely kill your motivation. It will be made clear to you how your story isn't worth reading in its current state and you will realize how all your love and effort has gone to waste.

## Disclaimer

This outline template is only for your narrative. In other words, it is only for your sequence of scenes leading to a climax and resolution of central story question. This outline does *not* cover three of the four story elements: **characters**, **setting**, and **themes**. This outline only covers **narrative**.

This outline template is not a substitute for learning the craft of story telling. Following this outline does not guarantee creativity, reader engagement, or a successful writing or editing process. This outline template only guarantees a baseline in the quality of your outline.

Feel free to modify and redistribute this outline as it belongs to the public domain.

# SPOOC

SPOOC is a 2 sentences template to test your story's fundamentals, to assure yourself that it is sturdy enough to last a book The first sentence establishes the situation, and the second turns the central story goal into a question.

SPOOC stands for:
- Situation
- Protagonist
- Objective
- Opponent
- Climax

## Example

- Situation: when he is approached by Gandalf
- Protagonist: Frodo
- Objective: is tasked with destroying the One Ring. But can he throw it in Mount Doom when
- Opponent: Sauron
- Climax: tempts Frodo with the ring's power, risking the Middle-earth's fate?

# Conflict Scene

A story is divided into scenes. Do not confuse scenes in novels with scenes in cinema. In motion pictures, a scene consists of a single location or a continuous shot/period of time, while in novels, a scene is a narrative unit consisting of a story goal, a twist, and a resolution.

There are two kinds of scenes: [conflict scenes](#conflict-scene) and [sequels](#sequel) (not related to the next instalment of a series). Conflict scenes serve to advance the central story question while sequels elaborate on the physical and emotional consequences of a previous conflict scene, and orient the story towards the next conflict scene. More onto sequels later.

- What is the length of the scene?

## Characters

Which characters will be part of the scene?

*Link your character sheets.*

## Viewpoint

Which type of viewpoint is used?

- [ ] First person

	Easy for the writer to write and for the readers to understand. Most intimate viewpoint. Difficult to plot for.

- [ ] Second person

	Provides no advantages, and destroys the suspension of disbelief

- [ ] Third person

	Most common, easiest to write, flexible

- [ ] Omniscient

	Provides a quick insight into several characters, but it is the hardest to write and nobody does it well. Thus, it is seldom used.

## Introduction

- Who is the protagonist?
- What is his goal and motivation?
- How is it established? (through dialogue, actions, or both?)
- What are the stakes?
- What is going on?

### Hook

How is the reader hooked in the scene?

- [ ] Introduce a vivid character

- [ ] Leaping into action
- [ ] Other

## Development

## Twist

Twists heighten the stakes and render the outcome of the scene uncertain, and can help in advancing the story. This results in increased reader engagement.

## Resolution

- In what way does the protagonist fail his goal?
- In what way does the protagonist struggle and grow?
- What is the story outcome?
	 1. [ ] Yes, the protagonist achieves his goal (reserved for antagonist's viewpoint or plot endings)

	 3. [ ] Yes, but things are now way worse for the protagonist
	 4. [ ] Yes, but the progress is slight and the protagonist is more doubtful
	 5. [ ] No, it is a disaster
- How will this impact the protagonist's situation?
- Which main story goal options have been removed?

# TODO Back Story

Monotony and predictability are common issues faced by writers, especially at the halfway mark of a novel.

# TODO Hidden Story

# TODO Central Story Event

# TODO Climax

# TODO Resolution

# Sequel

For ever [conflict scene](#conflict-scene), there must be another scene to asses its results and consequences, and to process a character's feelings, emotions, and thoughts. This scene is called a sequel (not to confuse with another opus of a series). The sequel should also let the protagonist review the events that occurred and formulate a new story plan. The sequel can be deferred for better pacing and emotional impact, but it must happen at some point. Its length can be from just a few lines long to an entire chapter.

- What is the length of the sequel?
- How is the sequel linked to the surrounding scenes?

## Components (in written order)

- What is the emotional aftermath?
- What is the analysis of the problem?
- What recent events just occurred?
- Which options does the protagonist have to achieve his story goal?
- What is the protagonist's decision?

## Checklist
- [ ] is the sequel proceeding a scene?
- [ ] is the sequel's length different from the majority of the others'?
- [ ] does the emotional intensity match the conflict and its stepback?
- [ ] do the protagonist's emotions create empathy for readers?
- [ ] are the protagonist's emotions vividly described? (sensory details, body language, internal monologue, dialogue, metaphor/similes)
- [ ] are important story elements mentioned?
- [ ] is the protagonist's story goal mentioned?
- [ ] does the protagonist's decision make sense considering their resources and environment?
- [ ] will the protagonist's decision result in further conflict?
