In this post, I will present the outline template I use for designing compelling and well-structured narratives.

Outlining is a crucial step of the writing pipeline, which can be divided into three major steps: outlining, writing, and editing. Without a solid outline, the writing process will slow down to a crawl and insecurities will creep in as you progress through the chapters. Your story won't be cohesive and your characters will meander around. You will have wished you outlined beforehand. If you somehow get through the gruelling writing process, editing will surely kill your motivation. It will be made clear to you how your story isn't worth reading in its current state and you will realize how all your love and effort has gone to waste.

## Disclaimer

This outline template is only for your narrative. In other words, it is only for your sequence of scenes leading to a climax and resolution of central story question. This outline does *not* cover three of the four story elements: **characters**, **setting**, and **themes**. This outline only covers **narrative**.

This outline template is not a substitute for learning the craft of story telling. Following this outline does not guarantee creativity, reader engagement, or a successful writing or editing process. This outline template only guarantees a baseline in the quality of your outline.

Feel free to modify and redistribute this outline as it belongs to the public domain.

## SPOOC

SPOOC is a 2 sentences template to test your story's fundamentals, to assure yourself that it is sturdy enough to last a book. The first sentence establishes the situation, and the second turns the central story goal into a question.

SPOOC stands for:
- Situation
- Protagonist
- Objective
- Opponent
- Climax

### Example

- Situation: when he is approached by Gandalf
- Protagonist: Frodo
- Objective: is tasked with destroying the One Ring. But can he throw it in Mount Doom when
- Opponent: Sauron
- Climax: tempts Frodo with the ring's power, risking the Middle-earth's fate?

## Conflict Scene

A story is divided into scenes. Do not confuse scenes in a novel with scenes in a film. In motion pictures, a scene consists of a single location or a continuous shot/period of time, while in novels, a scene is a narrative unit consisting of a story goal, a twist, and a resolution.

There are two kinds of scenes: [conflict scenes](#conflict-scene) and [sequels](#sequel) (not related to the next instalment of a series). Conflict scenes serve to advance the central story question while sequels elaborate on the physical and emotional consequences of a previous conflict scene, and orient the story towards the next conflict scene. More onto sequels later.

### Length

What is the length of the scene?

### Characters

Which characters will be part of the scene?

*Link your character sheets.*

### Viewpoint

Which type of viewpoint is used?

- [ ] First person

	Easy for the writer to write and for the readers to understand. Most intimate viewpoint. Difficult to plot for.

- [ ] Second person

	Provides no advantages and destroys the suspension of disbelief.

- [ ] Third person

	Most common, easiest to write, flexible.

- [ ] Omniscient

	Provides a quick insight into several characters, but it is the hardest to write and nobody does it well. Thus, it is seldom used.

### Introduction

### Smaller Story Questions

A novel cannot rely on just one major story question; it must incorporate numerous smaller, interconnected questions to keep the reader engaged. Their investment will increase as more story questions are introduced, adding layers of intrigue to the story. This process should begin from the very first page where there should be a steady flow of new questions and their matching answers. Nearing the end of the story, questions should be answered more frequently than asked, and all questions should be answered by the end. This keeps the narrative dynamic and compelling.

In a well-constructed chapter, there can be anywhere from **10 to 30 story questions**, some lingering through the entire novel, others resolved within the a single paragraph. Each question should be mentioned within a regular rhythm, every three to ten pages to maintain narrative momentum. 10 to 30 questions may seem like a high amount but they are naturally introduced by writers. Diligently outlining each one is not crucial, but do have a general plan for them.

- Which smaller story questions are asked?
- Which smaller story questions are re-mentioned?
- Which smaller story questions are answered?

#### Examples

I encourage you to read the first page of your favorite novel and isolate all the smaller story questions. Here are the ones I found from the first page of *Storm Front* by Jim Butcher:

- Why does the mailman laugh at Dresden's front door?
- Why do people vandalize Dresden's front door sign?
- Dresden is revealed to be a wizard. Is this claim legitimate, and what does it entail?
- What kind of bad news does Dresden get as mail?
- What is Dresden's newly arrived mail about?
- It is revealed to be a notice from his landlord. What kind of conflict does Dresden have with his landlord?
- Why does Dresden not provide love potions? (They are mentioned again in chapter 8 and paid off in chapter 14).
- What is the paranormal?
- How do normal people interact with the paranormal?

All these questions are considering the main, central story question: <u>will Dresden resolve the case of Monica Sells</u>?

### Twist

Twists heighten the stakes and render the outcome of the scene uncertain, and can help in advancing the story. This results in increased reader engagement.

It is debatable whether every conflict scene should have a twist, but the outcome of every conflict scene should be uncertain as to avoid monotony and predictability.

- What twists or unexpected developments are in the scene?

### Resolution

- In what way does the protagonist fail his goal?
- In what way does the protagonist struggle and grow?
- What is the story outcome?
	 1. [ ] Yes, the protagonist achieves his goal (reserved for antagonist's viewpoint or plot endings).
	 2. [ ] No, the protagonist is back where they started.
	 3. [ ] Yes, but things are now way worse for the protagonist (use most often).
	 4. [ ] Yes, but the progress is slight and the protagonist is more doubtful.
	 5. [ ] No, it is a disaster (use sparingly, best reserved for the twist in the middle of the story).
- How will this impact the protagonist's situation?
- Which main story goal options have been removed?

### Checklist

- [ ] Is there a hook at the very beginning of the scene?
- [ ] Is the sceneâ€™s length different from the majority of the others'?
- [ ] Are there smaller hooks peppered throughout the scene?
- [ ] Is the viewpoint clear?
- [ ] Does the viewpoint remain static?
- [ ] Is there a scene goal all throughout the scene?
- [ ] Is the protagonist's scene goal clear?
- [ ] Is there only one major scene goal?
- [ ] Is the protagonist active and proactive?
- [ ] Is the antagonist present early?
- [ ] Are the 5W1H clear? (when, where, what, who, why, how)
- [ ] Are the stakes high and higher than all previous scenes? (N/A for resolution)
- [ ] Is the outcome not determined by luck or fate?
- [ ] Is there suspense in the uncertainty of the outcome?
- [ ] Is the protagonist capable of resolving the conflict? (is it not hopeless from the start?)
- [ ] Does the scene end in at least partial failure for the protagonist? (N/A for climax)
- [ ] Is the protagonist taking riskier decisions than previous scenes by necessity? (N/A for resolution)
- [ ] Does the protagonist suffer the consequences of those risky decisions in previous chapters?
- [ ] Is there internal conflict?
- [ ] Is there external conflict?
- [ ] Is there social conflict?

## TODO Back Story

Monotony and predictability are common issues faced by writers, especially at the halfway mark of a novel.

## TODO Hidden Story

## TODO Central Story Event

## TODO Climax

## TODO Resolution

## Sequel

For ever [conflict scene](#conflict-scene), there must be another scene to asses its results and consequences, and to process a character's feelings, emotions, and thoughts. This scene is called a sequel (not to confuse with another opus of a series). The sequel should also let the protagonist review the events that occurred and formulate a new story plan. The sequel can be deferred for better pacing and emotional impact, but it must happen at some point. Its length can be from just a few lines long to an entire chapter.

- What is the length of the sequel?
- How is the sequel linked to the surrounding scenes?

### Components (in written order)

- What is the emotional aftermath?
- What is the analysis of the problem?
- What recent events just occurred?
- Which options does the protagonist have to achieve his story goal?
- What is the protagonist's decision?

### Checklist
- [ ] is the sequel proceeding a scene?
- [ ] is the sequel's length different from the majority of the others'?
- [ ] does the emotional intensity match the conflict and its stepback?
- [ ] do the protagonist's emotions create empathy for readers?
- [ ] are the protagonist's emotions vividly described? (sensory details, body language, internal monologue, dialogue, metaphor/similes)
- [ ] are important story elements mentioned?
- [ ] is the protagonist's story goal mentioned?
- [ ] does the protagonist's decision make sense considering their resources and environment?
- [ ] will the protagonist's decision result in further conflict?
