## Terminology

This article won't mention the commonly used terms *pro-choice* and *pro-life,* as they are biased and politically framed.

Instead, these terms will be used:

- **anti-abortion**: the belief that abortions are inherently immoral.
- **anti-anti-abortion**: the belief that abortions are not inherently immoral.

## Disclaimer

This is an article proving six common anti-abortion arguments to be either fallacies, self-contradictory, or false.

This article will **only consider morality**, even if this debate is inherently political and often encompasses policy. Since policy attempts to reach a compromise while considering other factors than morality, such as economic factors, this article will not consider policy.

Despite this article leaning toward an anti-anti-abortion stance, it does not make any such moral claim, as it is beyond the scope of this essay.

This article is **not targeting or attacking** any specific individuals or beliefs. This blog is a safe and secular space for all individuals and ideas.

## Six Arguments

### 1. Right to Life for the Unborn

>The core of the anti-abortion position is the belief that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a distinct individual with a right to life. This belief is based on the idea that, from the moment of conception, the fetus has its own DNA and the potential to develop into a full-grown human.
>
>Anti-abortion advocates argue that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives.

While we can agree that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives, the right to life hinges on a true and universal definition of life — one that remains undefined as of now.

Despite this, different anti-abortion stances follow different definitions. Common components include a completed strand of DNA and developing cells.

Some would argue that life involves more than DNA. Other crucial factors often include: the ability to reproduce, maintaining homeostasis, metabolic processes, a life-sustaining cellular structure, and reacting to stimuli. None of these definitions can be proven to be true, as each either encompasses what is obviously not life or excludes what is obviously life.

For example, the claim that life requires reproduction excludes five-year-old children who, despite this, are considered life. Another example considers frogs who can still react to electrical stimuli, despite being dead.

In regards to those points and fetuses, until the second trimester (weeks 13-26), they do not react to stimuli, are not able to maintain homeostasis, have a limited metabolism, possess a different cellular structure than children, and are not equipped with reproductive organs — not even immature ones. These are valid but inconclusive arguments against first-trimester fetuses being alive.

In regards to the original definition consisting of possessing a completed strand of DNA with developing cells, early corpses also possess these attributes, but it does not mean that corpses are alive. 

This issue of definitions is closely related to the [Sorites Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox):

>If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, the question is at what exact point it ceases to be considered a heap?

This paradox points out the blurry lines between transitional states like during a fetus' development. If a single unfertilized egg is not a human life, but a born child is, at what exact point the fetus can be considered a human life? Since there is not yet a universal definition of life, we cannot consider all fetuses to be alive. Therefore, the argument that abortion is immoral based on the premise that fetuses are alive remains currently unsubstantiated.

### 2. Religious Beliefs

>Many anti-abortion supporters hold strong religious beliefs about the sanctity of life. For them, terminating a pregnancy is viewed as morally wrong, and they believe that ending a life should only occur in extreme cases (or not at all).

When approaching a philosophical debate, it is important to remain secular. This demands prioritizing reason, empirical evidence, and human experience over religious doctrines or spiritual beliefs. But it does **not** mean disregarding or denying religion, or claiming moral superiority.

Religious texts and theology can be used in secular debates with great results, as long reason as is prioritized. But even without theological involvement, results of secular debates often align with religious beliefs, they are not incompatible.

For example Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used Christian theology to advocate for equality and justice in [Letter from Birmingham Jail](https://letterfromjail.com/):

>I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their “thus saith the Lord” far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town.

This said, claiming that abortion is wrong only by referring to biblical passages such as Exodus 20:13 "*you shall not murder*," or Psalm 139:13-16 "*for you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb*," does not constitute a valid argument as this is considered an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) and faith. Reason can be used to elaborate on those quotes, but as it stands, appeals to authority are not a valid argument.

### 3. Concern for Potential Harm to Women

>Anti-abortion advocates sometimes argue that abortion can have negative physical and emotional effects on people who undergo it. They cite studies or personal accounts of individuals who regret their abortions or experience lasting psychological impacts, like grief or guilt.

It is true that abortions have significant physically and emotionally tolls, even if most women who have an abortion are not more likely than those denied the procedure to have depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation.[^1] Abortions are also medical procedures, and all procedures include risks of complications, but research shows that safe abortions carried out using a method recommended by the World Health Organization are considered very-safe with deaths only occurring in 0.001% of cases.[^2]

Regardless of the numbers presented in those studies, the moral claim from this argument is self-contradicting because giving birth is also physically and emotionally tolling, and the risks of complications are high. The World Health Organization stated that "every day in 2020, almost 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth."[^3]

This is a comprehensive list of common mental and physical struggles women may experience during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period:

- **Mental and Emotional Struggles**

  - **During Pregnancy**
    - Anxiety and Worry
    - Depression (Perinatal Depression)
    - Mood Swings
    - Body Image and Self-Esteem Issues
    - Sleep Disruptions and Resulting Fatigue

  - **During Childbirth**
    - Fear and Anxiety about Labor and Delivery
    - Vulnerability and Emotional Sensitivity

  - **After Pregnancy (Postpartum)**
    - Postpartum Depression
    - Anxiety and Postpartum Anxiety Disorders
    - Emotional Attachment and Bonding Challenges
    - Guilt and Self-Doubt
    - Feelings of Isolation and Loneliness
    - Stress from Role Changes and Responsibilities
    - Pressure to Meet Societal or Personal Expectations

- **Physical Struggles**

  - **During Pregnancy**
    - Nausea and Vomiting (Morning Sickness)
    - Fatigue
    - Body Changes and Weight Gain
    - Back Pain and Joint Pain
    - Swelling (Edema)
    - Shortness of Breath
    - Digestive Issues (Heartburn, Constipation)
    - Varicose Veins and Hemorrhoids
    - Gestational Diabetes and High Blood Pressure
    - Sleep Discomfort

 - **During Childbirth**
    - Labor Pain and Discomfort
    - Exhaustion from Labor
    - Risk of Medical Complications

  - **After Pregnancy (Postpartum)**
    - Postpartum Recovery Pain
    - Lactation Discomfort
    - Hormonal Changes and Hair Loss
    - Fatigue and Sleep Deprivation
    - Increased Risk of Infections
    - Urinary Incontinence and Pelvic Floor Weakness
    - Diastasis Recti and Abdominal Weakness
    - Challenges with Sexual Health and Intimacy

If abortions are immoral because of the physical and mental impact on those who undergo the procedure, then giving birth is also immoral for the same reason. But since giving birth is not seen as immoral according to either anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs, this point is self-contradicting.

### 4. Support for Alternatives like Adoption

>Anti-abortion supporters often advocate for alternatives to abortion, such as adoption. They argue that choosing adoption gives the child a chance at life while also potentially fulfilling the desires of families who are unable to have children naturally.
>
>Many in the anti-abortion movement push for more support for pregnant individuals, such as better access to healthcare, social services, and other resources to help make parenting or adoption a more viable choice.

It is true that adoption gives children a chance to live potentially fulfilling lives and that families unable to conceive greatly benefit from it.

It is also well known that adoption services are underfunded and that the adoption process for qualified families is lengthy, difficult, and expensive. This difficult hurtle stops many families from adopting and orphans from being adopted. Further funding to the adoption sector could greatly improve the lives of both families and orphans.[^4]

But regardless, adoption and abortion can coexist; there is nothing stopping orphanages from existing along with abortion clinics.

There will be orphans of deceased or otherwise unavailable parents regardless of the popularity of abortions, and gynecologists can still offer abortion services regardless of the success of adoption centers.

This point is a false dilemma, and thus is invalid.

#### 4b. Choosing Between Adoption and Abortion

In regards to the moral choice of a pregnant woman contemplating both abortion and adoption, it is impossible to determine which option is the most moral.

This situation falls under the concept of **moral incommensurability**, where two options uphold different moral values. In this case, abortion promotes personal autonomy, bodily integrity, choice of reproductive right, health and well-being, and gender quality while adoption promotes the value of a potential life, family, societal contributions, and child welfare.

Since these different values do not share a common moral framework for comparison, they are considered incommensurable, and as such it is impossible to prove which is morally superior.

This dilemma is non-conclusive.

### 5. Protecting and Valuing Vulnerable Lives

>From a philosophical perspective, anti-abortion supporters often believe that society has an obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, including the unborn. This belief stems from the idea that one’s value is intrinsic and not dependent on development stage, viability, or circumstance.
>
>For anti-abortion advocates, this means treating the unborn with the same respect and care as other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or disabled.

Anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs both agree on society's obligation to protect its most vulnerable members such as children and the unborn, but pregnant women are also considered vulnerable members of society due to their health risks, mental health concerns, economic disadvantages, reliance on the support and resources of others, and societal norms.

During certain medical complications, abortions can be necessary in order to save the lives of pregnant women.[^3] Such an example of a medical condition are ectopic pregnancies which occur when the fetus develops outside the uterus, such as in the fallopian tubes. When untreated, this condition can cause internal bleeding and death. In the US, 2 out of 100 pregnancies are ectopic.[^5] Pregancy could also contribute to mental health issues, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which affect pregnant women more than non-pregnant women (6-8% vs. 4-5%).[^6]

[it has been explained how women are vulnerable members of society, explain how they might need abortion]

[explore the concept of moral prioritization, which is more valuable, the baby or the parent]

[Abortions are often needed when the woman is too young to take good care of the infant or when there are complications which could lead to the death of the mother. Pregnant women are vulnerable members of society, too. Since this argument contradicts itself, it is not valid.]

### 6. Concerns About a "Culture of Death"

>Some anti-abortion advocates worry that allowing abortion contributes to a "culture of death" where life becomes seen as conditional or disposable. They believe that society should aim to support and protect life at all stages and that abortion undermines this commitment.
>
>This argument ties into broader concerns that legal abortion may devalue life by making it acceptable to end a life based on circumstances or convenience.

[The reality is that nearly nobody celebrates abortions as an enjoyable event. Also, death is already a very important part of our culture, it's a crucial story telling device in nearly all religious text, myths and legends. Like the death of Christ, for example. Burials and other funeral ceremonies are also very important to our culture, and one could argue that birthdays are also related to the "culture of death." Since we already a celebrated culture of death and abortions aren't part of that culture, this argument is false.]
