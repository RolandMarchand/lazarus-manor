## Terminology

This article won't mention the commonly used terms *pro-choice* and *pro-life,* as they are biased and politically framed.

Instead, these terms will be used:

- **anti-abortion**: the belief that abortions are inherently immoral.
- **anti-anti-abortion**: the belief that abortions are not inherently immoral.

## Disclaimer

This is an article proving six common anti-abortion arguments to be either fallacies, self-contradictory, or false.

This article will **only consider morality**, even if this debate is inherently political and often encompasses policy. Since policy attempts to reach a compromise while considering more factors than morality, such as economic factors, this article will not consider policy.

Despite the article leaning toward an anti-anti-abortion stance, it does not make any such moral claim, as this is beyond the scope of this essay.

This article is **not targeting or attacking** any specific individuals or beliefs. This blog is a safe and secular space for all individuals and ideas.

## Six Arguments

### 1. Right to Life for the Unborn

[edited]

>The core of the anti-abortion position is the belief that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a distinct individual with a right to life. This belief is based on the idea that, from the moment of conception, the fetus has its own DNA and the potential to develop into a full-grown human.
>
>Anti-abortion advocates argue that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives.

While we can agree that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives, the right to life hinges on a true and universal definition of life — one that remains undefined as of now.

Despite this, different anti-abortion stances follow different definitions. Common components include a completed strand of DNA and developing cells.

Some would argue that life involves more than DNA. Other crucial factors often include: the ability to reproduce, maintaining homeostasis, metabolic processes, a life-sustaining cellular structure, and reacting to stimuli. None of these definitions can be proven to be true, as each either encompasses what is obviously not life or excludes what is obviously life.

For example, the claim that life requires reproduction excludes five-year-old children who, despite this, are considered life. Another example considers frogs who can still react to electrical stimuli, despite being dead.

In regards to those points and fetuses, until the second trimester (weeks 13-26), they do not react to stimuli, are not able to maintain homeostasis, have a limited metabolism, possess a different cellular structure than children, and are not equipped with reproductive organs — not even immature ones. These are valid but inconclusive arguments against first-trimester fetuses being alive.

In regards to the original definition consisting of possessing a completed strand of DNA with developing cells, early corpses also possess these attributes, but it does not mean that corpses are alive. 

This issue of definitions is closely related to the [Sorites Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox):

>If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, the question is at what exact point it ceases to be considered a heap?

This paradox points out the blurry lines between transitional states like during a fetus' development. If a single unfertilized egg is not a human life, but a born child is, at what exact point the fetus can be considered a human life? Since there is not yet a universal definition of life, we cannot consider all fetuses to be alive. Therefore, the argument that abortion is immoral based on the premise that fetuses are alive remains currently unsubstantiated.

### 2. Religious Beliefs

>Many anti-abortion supporters hold strong religious beliefs about the sanctity of life. For them, terminating a pregnancy is viewed as morally wrong, and they believe that ending a life should only occur in extreme cases (or not at all).

When approaching a philosophical debate, it is important to remain secular. This demands prioritizing reason, empirical evidence, and human experience over religious doctrines or spiritual beliefs. But it does **not** mean disregarding or denying religion, or claiming moral superiority.

Religious texts and theology can be used in secular debates with great results, as long reason as is prioritized.

[give example of theology used effectively]

Even without theological involvement, results of secular debates often align with religious beliefs, they are not incompatible.

For example Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used Christian theology to advocate for equality and justice

This said, claiming that abortion is wrong only by referring to biblical passages such as Exodus 20:13 "*you shall not murder*," or Psalm 139:13-16 "*for you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb*," does not constitute a valid argument as this is considered an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) and faith. Reason can be used to elaborate on those quotes, but as it stands, appeals to authority are not a valid argument.

### 3. Concern for Potential Harm to Women

>Anti-abortion advocates sometimes argue that abortion can have negative physical and emotional effects on people who undergo it. They cite studies or personal accounts of individuals who regret their abortions or experience lasting psychological impacts, like grief or guilt.

It is true that abortions have significant physically and emotionally tolls, even if most women who have an abortion are not more likely than those denied the procedure to have depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation[^1]. Abortions are also medical procedures, and all procedures include risks of complications, but research shows that abortions given by professionals are generally considered very-safe with complications occurring in less than 2% of cases. [source needed]

Regardless of the numbers presented in those studies, this point is invalid for another reason: it is self-contradicting. Giving birth is also physically and emotionally tolling, and the risks of complications are rather high. [source needed]

[expand on how giving birth is physically and emotionally demanding]

If abortions are immoral because of the physical and mental impact on those who have one, then giving birth is immoral. Giving birth is not seen as immoral according to either anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs, so this point is self-contradicting.

### 4. Support for Alternatives like Adoption

>Anti-abortion supporters often advocate for alternatives to abortion, such as adoption. They argue that choosing adoption gives the child a chance at life while also potentially fulfilling the desires of families who are unable to have children naturally.
>
>Many in the anti-abortion movement push for more support for pregnant individuals, such as better access to healthcare, social services, and other resources to help make parenting or adoption a more viable choice.

It is true that adoption gives children a chance to live potentially fulfilling lives and that families unable to conceive greatly benefit from it.

It is also well known that adoption services are underfunded[source needed] and that the adoption process for qualified families is lengthy, difficult, and expensive[source needed]. This difficult hurtle stops many families from adopting and orphans from being adopted. Further funding to the adoption sector could greatly improve the lives of both families and orphans.

But regardless, adoption and abortion can coexist; there is nothing stopping orphanages from existing along with abortion clinics.

There will be orphans of deceased or otherwise unavailable parents regardless of the popularity of abortions, and gynecologists can still offer abortions regardless of the popularity of the service is and the amount of orphans.

This point is a false dilemma, and thus is invalid.

### 5. Protecting and Valuing Vulnerable Lives

>From a philosophical perspective, anti-abortion supporters often believe that society has an obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, including the unborn. This belief stems from the idea that one’s value is intrinsic and not dependent on development stage, viability, or circumstance.
>
>For anti-abortion advocates, this means treating the unborn with the same respect and care as other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or disabled.

Anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs both agree on society's obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, and children, unborn or not, are included in that definition. But that definition also includes pregnant women who are more vulnerable to illnesses and experience physical limitations due to pregnancy, and thus less independent.

[research and describe how abortions can protect vulnerable lives of pregnant women].

[Abortions are often needed when the woman is too young to take good care of the infant or when there are complications which could lead to the death of the mother. Pregnant women are vulnerable members of society, too. Since this argument contradicts itself, it is not valid.]

### 6. Concerns About a "Culture of Death"

>Some anti-abortion advocates worry that allowing abortion contributes to a "culture of death" where life becomes seen as conditional or disposable. They believe that society should aim to support and protect life at all stages and that abortion undermines this commitment.
>
>This argument ties into broader concerns that legal abortion may devalue life by making it acceptable to end a life based on circumstances or convenience.

[The reality is that nearly nobody celebrates abortions as an enjoyable event. Also, death is already a very important part of our culture, it's a crucial story telling device in nearly all religious text, myths and legends. Like the death of Christ, for example. Burials and other funeral ceremonies are also very important to our culture, and one could argue that birthdays are also related to the "culture of death." Since we already a celebrated culture of death and abortions aren't part of that culture, this argument is false.]
