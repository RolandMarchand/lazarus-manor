## Terminology
This article will avoid the commonly used terms *pro-choice* and *pro-life* due to their inherently biased and politically charged nature. Instead, the following terms will be used:
- **anti-abortion**: encompassing all abortion-related beliefs that consider it inherently immoral
- **anti-anti-abortion**: encompassing all abortion-related beliefs that do *not* consider it inherently immoral

## Disclaimer
This article aims to demonstrate that six common anti-abortion arguments are either fallacious, self-contradictory, or false. The analysis will **only consider morality**, despite the debate's inherently political nature and potential policy implications. While policy seeks compromise by considering various factors beyond morality—such as economic considerations—this essay will not address those aspects.

Although the article leans toward an anti-anti-abortion perspective, it does not make any definitive moral claims, as such assertions lie beyond the scope of this essay. This blog is **not targeting or attacking** any specific individuals or beliefs, but rather provides a safe and secular space for intellectual discourse.

## Six Arguments
### 1. Right to Life for the Unborn
>The core of the anti-abortion position is the belief that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a distinct individual with a right to life. This belief is based on the idea that, from the moment of conception, the fetus has its own DNA and the potential to develop into a full-grown human.
>
>Anti-abortion advocates argue that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives.

While we can agree that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives, the right to life depends on a true and universal definition of life—a definition that remains undefined.

Different anti-abortion stances propose varying definitions, with common components including a completed DNA strand and developing cells. However, some argue that life involves more than DNA. Additional crucial factors often cited include: the ability to reproduce, maintaining homeostasis, metabolic processes, a life-sustaining cellular structure, and responsiveness to stimuli.

Critically, none of these definitions can be conclusively proven, as each either encompasses what is obviously not life or excludes what is unquestionably alive. For instance, the claim that life requires reproduction would exclude five-year-old children, who are considered living beings. Conversely, the argument about stimuli response falls short when considering that dead frogs can still react to electrical impulses.

Regarding fetuses, specifically during the first trimester (weeks 0-13), they do not meet several key life criteria: they do not react to stimuli, cannot maintain homeostasis, have limited metabolism, possess a fundamentally different cellular structure compared to children, and lack reproductive organs—even in an immature state. While these observations provide compelling arguments, they remain inconclusive in determining whether first-trimester fetuses are alive.

The original definition of possessing a completed DNA strand with developing cells is equally problematic, as early corpses also exhibit these attributes without being considered living entities.

This definitional challenge closely resembles the [Sorites Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox):
>If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, the question is at what exact point it ceases to be considered a heap?

The paradox highlights the blurry boundaries between transitional states during fetal development. If a single unfertilized egg is not considered human life, and a born child indisputably is, at what precise moment does the fetus become a human life? Given the absence of a universal life definition, we cannot categorically assert that all fetuses are alive.

Consequently, the argument that abortion is immoral based on the premise of fetal life remains unsubstantiated. Until a comprehensive, universally accepted definition of life emerges, this fundamental claim lacks conclusive philosophical or scientific grounding.

### 2. Religious Beliefs

>Many anti-abortion supporters hold strong religious beliefs about the sanctity of life. For them, terminating a pregnancy is viewed as morally wrong, and they believe that ending a life should only occur in extreme cases (or not at all).

When approaching a philosophical debate, maintaining a secular perspective is crucial. This approach demands prioritizing reason, empirical evidence, and human experience over religious doctrines or spiritual beliefs. However, this does **not** mean disregarding or denying religion, or claiming moral superiority.

Religious texts and theological perspectives can be compelling in secular debates when reason remains the primary framework. Importantly, secular debates and religious beliefs are not inherently incompatible; in fact, they often align despite different foundational approaches.

A profound example emerges in Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s theological rhetoric in his Letter from Birmingham Jail:[^11]
>I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their "thus saith the Lord" far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town.

Nevertheless, claiming abortion's moral status solely by referencing biblical passages—such as Exodus 20:13's "*you shall not murder*" or Psalm 139:13-16's "*for you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb*"—constitutes an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority). While these scriptural passages can inspire deeper philosophical reasoning, they cannot independently serve as substantive argumentative proof. Reason must elaborate on such quotes; isolated religious references do not constitute valid philosophical discourse.

### 3. Concern for Potential Harm to Women
>Anti-abortion advocates sometimes argue that abortion can have negative physical and emotional effects on people who undergo it. They cite studies or personal accounts of individuals who regret their abortions or experience lasting psychological impacts, like grief or guilt.

While abortions do indeed carry significant physical and emotional tolls, comprehensive research reveals nuanced perspectives. Most women who undergo the procedure are not more likely to experience depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation compared to those denied the procedure.[^1] As a medical intervention, abortion—like any procedure—involves potential complications. However, research demonstrates that safe abortions performed using World Health Organization-recommended methods are remarkably low-risk, with mortality occurring in only 0.001% of cases.[^2]

Beyond statistical analysis, the moral argument reveals a profound self-contradiction. Childbirth itself is equally—if not more—physically and emotionally demanding, with substantial health risks. The World Health Organization highlights this reality, reporting that "every day in 2020, almost 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth."[^3]

A comprehensive examination of women's experiences reveals the multifaceted challenges inherent in pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period:

**Mental and Emotional Struggles**
- **During Pregnancy**
  - Anxiety and Persistent Worry
  - Perinatal Depression
  - Emotional Volatility
  - Body Image and Self-Esteem Challenges
  - Disrupted Sleep and Resulting Exhaustion

- **During Childbirth**
  - Profound Anxiety about Labor
  - Emotional Vulnerability
  - Overwhelming Sensory and Psychological Intensity

- **Postpartum Period**
  - Postpartum Depression
  - Complex Anxiety Disorders
  - Emotional Attachment Difficulties
  - Pervasive Guilt and Self-Doubt
  - Profound Isolation
  - Transformative Stress from Role Transitions
  - Societal and Personal Expectation Pressures

**Physical Struggles**
- **During Pregnancy**
  - Persistent Nausea and Vomiting
  - Comprehensive Bodily Transformations
  - Chronic Fatigue
  - Musculoskeletal Discomfort
  - Systemic Physiological Adaptations
  - Cardiovascular and Metabolic Challenges

- **During Childbirth**
  - Intense Physical Trauma
  - Prolonged Exhaustion
  - High Medical Risks

- **Postpartum Period**
  - Extended Physical Recovery
  - Hormonal Disruptions
  - Systemic Physiological Recalibration
  - Persistent Physical Vulnerabilities

If abortion is deemed immoral due to its physical and psychological impact, then by identical logic, childbirth must be equally—if not more—morally questionable. Yet neither anti-abortion nor anti-anti-abortion perspectives categorically condemn childbirth, rendering this argument fundamentally self-contradictory.

### 4. Support for Alternatives like Adoption

>Anti-abortion supporters often advocate for alternatives to abortion, such as adoption. They argue that choosing adoption gives the child a chance at life while also potentially fulfilling the desires of families who are unable to have children naturally.
>
>Many in the anti-abortion movement push for more support for pregnant individuals, such as better access to healthcare, social services, and other resources to help make parenting or adoption a more viable choice.

It is true that adoption gives children a chance to live potentially fulfilling lives and that families unable to conceive greatly benefit from it.

It is also well known that adoption services are underfunded and that the adoption process for qualified families is lengthy, difficult, and expensive. This difficult hurtle stops many families from adopting and orphans from being adopted. Further funding to the adoption sector could greatly improve the lives of both families and orphans.[^4]

But regardless, adoption and abortion can coexist; there is nothing stopping orphanages from existing along with abortion clinics.

There will be orphans of deceased or otherwise unavailable parents regardless of the popularity of abortions, and gynecologists can still offer abortion services regardless of the success of adoption centers.

This point is a false dilemma, and thus is invalid.

#### 4b. Choosing Between Adoption and Abortion

In regards to the moral choice of a pregnant woman contemplating both abortion and adoption, it is impossible to determine which option is the most moral.

This situation falls under the concept of **moral incommensurability**, where two options uphold different moral values. In this case, abortion promotes personal autonomy, bodily integrity, choice of reproductive right, health and well-being, and gender equality while adoption promotes the value of a potential life, family, societal contributions, and child welfare.

Since these different values do not share a common moral framework for comparison, they are considered incommensurable, and as such it is impossible to prove which is morally superior.

This dilemma is non-conclusive.

### 5. Protecting and Valuing Vulnerable Lives

>From a philosophical perspective, anti-abortion supporters often believe that society has an obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, including the unborn. This belief stems from the idea that one’s value is intrinsic and not dependent on development stage, viability, or circumstance.
>
>For anti-abortion advocates, this means treating the unborn with the same respect and care as other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or disabled.

Anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs both agree on society's obligation to protect its most vulnerable members such as the elderly or disabled. But according to both categories of beliefs, pregnant women are also considered to be vulnerable members due to their health risks[^10], mental health concerns[^6], or economic disadvantages[^9].

Pregnant women are more susceptible to health complications such as high blood pressure (hypertension), gestational diabetes, infections, preeclampsia, preterm labor, nausea, or anemia.[^10]

Pregnancy can also contribute to mental health issues, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which affect pregnant women more than non-pregnant women (6-8% vs. 4-5%).[^6]

Pregnant women also face financial challenges dur and after pregnancy:[^9]

- 24% of women reported unmet healthcare needs due to costs and 60% faced affordability concerns about medical bills and debt.
- Over half reported difficulty covering basic expenses, like housing and bills.
- Disruptions in insurance coverage postpartum increase risks of inadequate care and even privately insured women often face high out-of-pocket costs.

This comes into play when pregnant women experience medical complications requiring abortions.[^3] Such an example of a medical condition are ectopic pregnancies which occur when the fetus develops outside the uterus, such as in the fallopian tubes. When untreated, this condition can cause internal bleeding and death. In the US, 2 out of 100 pregnancies are ectopic.[^5]

Since pregnant women are vulnerable and are owed the same moral duty to be protected as the unborn, this point is self-contradictory.

### 6. Concerns About a "Culture of Death"

>Some anti-abortion advocates worry that allowing abortion contributes to a "culture of death" where life becomes seen as conditional or disposable. They believe that society should aim to support and protect life at all stages and that abortion undermines this commitment.
>
>This argument ties into broader concerns that legal abortion may devalue life by making it acceptable to end a life based on circumstances or convenience.

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
**Note**: for the sake of argument, "human life" in this section refers to humans after birth. This is by no means a universal definition, of which none exist. To learn more about this topic, see [section 1](#1-right-to-life-for-the-unborn).
{{< /alert >}}

It is true that certain societal systems or structures can lead to the devaluation of human life. For instance, war is seen as an essential part of modern civilization and is often described as "necessary evil". Other examples include popular industries like tobacco and alcohol, which contribute to long-term health risks. Cars are seen as a crucial part of many societies, yet they caused more than 40000 deaths in the US in 2022 alone. [^7]

In regards to abortion procedures, by definition, they cannot directly devalue the lives of those already born. This is evidenced in several ways: No legal framework has ever suggested that permitting abortion diminishes the rights or protections of living persons. In countries where abortion is legal, public health metrics and mortality statistics remain equally significant - deaths from accidents or diseases are not treated with less gravity. Moreover, these societies continue to invest heavily in life-saving initiatives, from healthcare improvements to accident prevention programs. The resources allocated to protecting and preserving life have not diminished with the legalization of abortion.

Therefore, the claim that abortion access somehow diminishes the value of existing human life lacks both logical and empirical support - there is simply no demonstrable connection between the two.

Since the influence of abortion on the value of human life is difficult to measure, claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without proof leads to a False Cause fallacy. Such an argument assumes a connection without sufficient evidence, making it invalid.

#### 6b. Celebrating a "Culture of Death"

Generally, abortions are not seen as enjoyable events or worthy of celebration. They are most often considered a medical procedure for those in need.

However, despite this, Western cultures already celebrate death. For example, funeral ceremonies, such as burials, are considered an important aspect of these cultures. It could also be argued that birthdays indirectly celebrate death, as they mark the time we have spent alive and stop being celebrated once we are dead.

Death is also a crucial storytelling element in folklore. Important deaths from the most significant stories and myths include King Arthur, Darth Vader, Achilles, Oedipus, Socrates, and Alexander Hamilton only to name a few.

But arguably, the most significant death in Western culture is that of Jesus Christ, the Savior of Christianity, a religion centered around His death. This event is commemorated by both Christians and non-Christians during Holy Week, which includes Good Friday and Easter.

In the United States, death of its citizens is commemorated in many ways, such as with memorials for soldiers who perished in wars[^8] (see figure 1).

![View of names etched into the granite face of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_reflection_in_low_light.jpg/1280px-Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_reflection_in_low_light.jpg "View of names etched into the granite face of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, by National Park Service - https://www.flickr.com/photos/42600860@N02/51971811478/")

Despite all these celebrations of death in culture, abortion has no such holiday. It isn't a common trope in stories, even modern ones, and abortions are often not celebrated by the people who undergo them, unlike burials.

Since we already have a culture of death, and abortion is not part of it, this point is false.
