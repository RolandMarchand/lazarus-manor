## Terminology

This article won't mention the commonly used terms *pro-choice* and *pro-life,* as they are biased and politically framed.

Instead, these terms will be used:

- **anti-abortion**: the belief that abortions are inherently immoral.
- **anti-anti-abortion**: the belief that abortions are not inherently immoral.

## Disclaimer

This is an article proving six common anti-abortion arguments to be either fallacies, self-contradictory, or false.

This article will **only consider morality**. This debate is sensitive and political, and as such, it generally encompasses policy. Policy goes beyond morality and attempts to reach a compromise while considering factors beyond the moral, such as economic ones. As such, this article will not consider policy.

Despite the article leaning toward an anti-anti-abortion stance, it **does not claim** any such moral arguments, as that is beyond the scope of this essay.

This article is **not targeting or attacking** any specific individuals or beliefs. This blog is a safe and secular space for all individuals and ideas.

## Six Arguments

### 1. Right to Life for the Unborn

>The core of the anti-abortion position is the belief that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a distinct individual with a right to life. This belief is based on the idea that, from the moment of conception, the fetus has its own DNA and the potential to develop into a full-grown human.
>
>Anti-abortion advocates argue that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives.

This point depends on a certain definition of life. Different anti-abortion stances may make the same point with slight variations in the definition, but it generally includes a completed strand of DNA with developing cells. The issue with this argument is that humanity has not yet found a universal and true definition of life, let alone human life.

Some would argue that life goes well beyond DNA and that other factors are crucial, such as the ability to reproduce, maintaining homeostasis, having metabolic processes, having a life-sustaining cellular structure, or reacting to stimuli. None of these definitions can be proven to be true, as each either encompasses what is obviously not life or excludes what is obviously life.

For example, the claim that life requires reproduction excludes five-year-old children, while they are clearly alive. As another example, frogs can still react to electrical stimuli, despite being dead.

In regards to those points and fetuses, until the second trimester (weeks 13-26), they do not react to stimuli, are not able to maintain homeostasis, have a limited metabolism, possess a different cellular structure compared to humans, and are not equipped with reproductive organs—not even immature ones. These are solid, but not definitive, arguments against first-trimester fetuses being alive.

In regards to the original definition of possessing a completed strand of DNA with developing cells, early corpses also possess these attributes, but it does not mean that corpses are alive. 

This issue of definitions is closely related to the [Sorites Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox):

>If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, the question is at what exact point it ceases to be considered a heap?

Since there is not yet a universal definition of life, we cannot consider all fetuses to be alive. Thus, the point that abortion is immoral because fetuses are alive is invalid.

<!-- ### 2. **Moral and Ethical Beliefs** -->
<!--    - Many anti-abortion supporters hold strong ethical or religious beliefs about the sanctity of life. For them, terminating a pregnancy is viewed as morally wrong, and they believe that ending a life should only occur in extreme cases (or not at all). -->
<!--    - Some anti-abortion advocates also argue that permitting abortion normalizes the idea of ending a life for personal convenience or comfort, which they believe has negative implications for society’s views on life in general. -->

<!-- ### 3. **Concern for Potential Harm to Women** -->
<!--    - anti-abortion advocates sometimes argue that abortion can have negative physical and emotional effects on people who undergo it. They cite studies or personal accounts of individuals who regret their abortions or experience lasting psychological impacts, like grief or guilt. -->
<!--    - They also believe that abortion providers may not always prioritize the health and well-being of the individual, viewing abortion as a quick solution rather than addressing underlying social, economic, or emotional issues that led to the pregnancy being unwanted. -->

<!-- ### 4. **Support for Alternatives like Adoption** -->
<!--    - anti-abortion supporters often advocate for alternatives to abortion, such as adoption. They argue that choosing adoption gives the child a chance at life while also potentially fulfilling the desires of families who are unable to have children naturally. -->
<!--    - Many in the anti-abortion movement push for more support for pregnant individuals, such as better access to healthcare, social services, and other resources to help make parenting or adoption a more viable choice. -->

<!-- ### 5. **Protecting Vulnerability and Value of Life** -->
<!--    - From a philosophical perspective, anti-abortion supporters often believe that society has an obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, including the unborn. This belief stems from the idea that one’s value is intrinsic and not dependent on development stage, viability, or circumstance. -->
<!--    - For anti-abortion advocates, this means treating the unborn with the same respect and care as other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or disabled. -->

<!-- ### 6. **Concerns About a "Culture of Death"** -->
<!--    - Some anti-abortion advocates worry that allowing abortion contributes to a "culture of death" where life becomes seen as conditional or disposable. They believe that society should aim to support and protect life at all stages and that abortion undermines this commitment. -->
<!--    - This argument ties into broader concerns that legal abortion may devalue life by making it acceptable to end a life based on circumstances or convenience. -->


<!-- 2. This is a religious bias, it does not prove or disprove anything about abortion -->
<!-- 3. Giving birth is also a very difficult process that has a mental and physical toll, and it can also be dangerous. If abortion is bad because of the risk to women, then giving birth is bad too. This point does not disprove the importance of abortion -->
<!-- 4. This is true that adoption is good, but adoption and abortions can coexist. Adoption does not disprove the value of abortion -->
<!-- 5. Abortions are often needed when the woman is too young to take good care of the infant or when there are complications which could lead to the death of the mother. Pregnant women are vulnerable members of society, too. Since this argument contradicts itself, it is not valid. -->
<!-- 6. The reality is that nearly nobody celebrates abortions as an enjoyable event. Also, death is already a very important part of our culture, it's a crucial story telling device in nearly all religious text, myths and legends. Like the death of Christ, for example. Burials and other funeral ceremonies are also very important to our culture, and one could argue that birthdays are also related to the "culture of death." Since we already a celebrated culture of death and abortions aren't part of that culture, this argument is false. -->
