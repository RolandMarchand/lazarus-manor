## Terminology
This article will avoid the commonly used terms *pro-choice* and *pro-life* due to their inherently biased and politically charged nature. Instead, the following terms will be used:
- **anti-abortion**: encompassing all abortion-related beliefs that consider it inherently immoral
- **anti-anti-abortion**: encompassing all abortion-related beliefs that do *not* consider it inherently immoral

## Disclaimer
This article demonstrates that six common anti-abortion arguments are either fallacious, self-contradictory, or false. The analysis will **only consider morality**. Despite politics and policy being inherent to this debate, they are beyond the scope of this article.

Although this article leans toward an anti-anti-abortion stance, it does not make any such moral claims, as this would be beyond the scope of this essay. This blog is **not targeting or attacking** any specific individuals or beliefs. It aims to be a safe and secular space for all individuals and ideas.

## Six Arguments
### COMPLETED 1. Right to Life for the Unborn

>The core of the anti-abortion position is the belief that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a distinct individual with a right to life. This belief is based on the idea that, from the moment of conception, the fetus has its own DNA and the potential to develop into a full-grown human.
>
>Anti-abortion advocates argue that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives.

While we can agree that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives, the right to life depends on a true and universal definition of life—a definition that remains undefined.

Different anti-abortion stances propose varying definitions, with common components including a completed DNA strand and developing cells. However, some argue that life involves more than DNA. Additional crucial factors often cited include: the ability to reproduce, maintaining homeostasis, metabolic processes, a life-sustaining cellular structure, and responsiveness to stimuli.

Critically, none of these definitions can be conclusively proven, as each either encompasses what is obviously not life or excludes what is unquestionably alive. For instance, the claim that life requires reproduction would exclude five-year-old children, who are considered living beings. Conversely, the argument about stimuli response falls short when considering that dead frogs can still react to electrical impulses.

Regarding fetuses, specifically during the first trimester (weeks 0-13), they do not meet several key life criteria: they do not react to stimuli, cannot maintain homeostasis, have limited metabolism, possess a fundamentally different cellular structure compared to children, and lack reproductive organs—even in an immature state. While these observations provide compelling arguments, they remain inconclusive in determining whether first-trimester fetuses are alive.

The original definition of possessing a completed DNA strand with developing cells is equally problematic, as early corpses also exhibit these attributes without being considered living entities.

This definitional challenge closely resembles the [Sorites Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox):
>If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, the question is at what exact point it ceases to be considered a heap?

The paradox highlights the blurry boundaries between transitional states during fetal development. If a single unfertilized egg is not considered human life, and a born child indisputably is, at what precise moment does the fetus become a human life? Given the absence of a universal life definition, we cannot categorically assert that all fetuses are alive.

Consequently, the argument that abortion is immoral based on the premise of fetal life remains unsubstantiated. Until a comprehensive, universally accepted definition of life emerges, this fundamental claim lacks conclusive philosophical or scientific grounding.

### 2. Religious Beliefs

>Many anti-abortion supporters hold strong religious beliefs about the sanctity of life. For them, terminating a pregnancy is viewed as morally wrong, and they believe that ending a life should only occur in extreme cases (or not at all).

When approaching a philosophical debate, maintaining a secular perspective is crucial. This approach demands prioritizing reason, empirical evidence, and human experience over religious doctrines or spiritual beliefs. However, this does **not** mean disregarding or denying religion, or claiming moral superiority.

Religious texts and theological perspectives can be compelling in secular debates when reason remains the primary framework. Importantly, secular debates and religious beliefs are not inherently incompatible; in fact, they often align despite different foundational approaches.

A profound example emerges in Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s theological rhetoric in his Letter from Birmingham Jail:[^11]
>I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their "thus saith the Lord" far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town.

Nevertheless, claiming abortion's moral status solely by referencing biblical passages—such as Exodus 20:13's "*you shall not murder*" or Psalm 139:13-16's "*for you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb*"—constitutes an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority). While these scriptural passages can inspire deeper philosophical reasoning, they cannot independently serve as substantive argumentative proof. Reason must elaborate on such quotes; isolated religious references do not constitute valid philosophical discourse.

### 3. Concern for Potential Harm to Women
>Anti-abortion advocates sometimes argue that abortion can have negative physical and emotional effects on people who undergo it. They cite studies or personal accounts of individuals who regret their abortions or experience lasting psychological impacts, like grief or guilt.

While abortions do indeed carry significant physical and emotional tolls, comprehensive research reveals nuanced perspectives. Most women who undergo the procedure are not more likely to experience depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation compared to those denied the procedure.[^1] As a medical intervention, abortion—like any procedure—involves potential complications. However, research demonstrates that safe abortions performed using World Health Organization-recommended methods are remarkably low-risk, with mortality occurring in only 0.001% of cases.[^2]

Beyond statistical analysis, the moral argument reveals a profound self-contradiction. Childbirth itself is equally—if not more—physically and emotionally demanding, with substantial health risks. The World Health Organization highlights this reality, reporting that "every day in 2020, almost 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth."[^3]

A comprehensive examination of women's experiences reveals the multifaceted challenges inherent in pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period:

**Mental and Emotional Struggles**
- **During Pregnancy**
  - Anxiety and Persistent Worry
  - Perinatal Depression
  - Emotional Volatility
  - Body Image and Self-Esteem Challenges
  - Disrupted Sleep and Resulting Exhaustion

- **During Childbirth**
  - Profound Anxiety about Labor
  - Emotional Vulnerability
  - Overwhelming Sensory and Psychological Intensity

- **Postpartum Period**
  - Postpartum Depression
  - Complex Anxiety Disorders
  - Emotional Attachment Difficulties
  - Pervasive Guilt and Self-Doubt
  - Profound Isolation
  - Transformative Stress from Role Transitions
  - Societal and Personal Expectation Pressures

**Physical Struggles**
- **During Pregnancy**
  - Persistent Nausea and Vomiting
  - Comprehensive Bodily Transformations
  - Chronic Fatigue
  - Musculoskeletal Discomfort
  - Systemic Physiological Adaptations
  - Cardiovascular and Metabolic Challenges

- **During Childbirth**
  - Intense Physical Trauma
  - Prolonged Exhaustion
  - High Medical Risks

- **Postpartum Period**
  - Extended Physical Recovery
  - Hormonal Disruptions
  - Systemic Physiological Recalibration
  - Persistent Physical Vulnerabilities

If abortion is deemed immoral due to its physical and psychological impact, then by identical logic, childbirth must be equally—if not more—morally questionable. Yet neither anti-abortion nor anti-anti-abortion perspectives categorically condemn childbirth, rendering this argument fundamentally self-contradictory.

### 4. Protecting and Valuing Vulnerable Lives

>From a philosophical perspective, anti-abortion supporters often believe that society has an obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, including the unborn. This belief stems from the idea that one's value is intrinsic and not dependent on development stage, viability, or circumstance.
>
>For anti-abortion advocates, this means treating the unborn with the same respect and care as other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or disabled.

Both anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs agree on society's obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, such as the elderly or disabled. According to both categories of beliefs, pregnant women are also considered vulnerable members due to their health risks[^10], mental health concerns[^6], and economic disadvantages[^9].

Pregnant women face significant health complications including high blood pressure (hypertension), gestational diabetes, infections, preeclampsia, preterm labor, nausea, and anemia[^10].

Some conditions require abortions[^3]. For instance, ectopic pregnancies occur when the fetus develops outside the uterus, such as in the fallopian tubes. When untreated, this condition can cause internal bleeding and death. In the US, 2 out of 100 pregnancies are ectopic[^5].

Pregnancy can also contribute to mental health issues, with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affecting pregnant women at notably higher rates than non-pregnant women (6-8% versus 4-5%)[^6].

Additionally, pregnant women often face financial challenges during and after pregnancy[^9]:

- 24% report unmet healthcare needs due to costs, and 60% face affordability concerns about medical bills and debt.
- Over half report difficulty covering basic expenses, like housing and bills.
- Disruptions in insurance coverage postpartum increase risks of inadequate care, and even privately insured women often face high out-of-pocket costs.

Considering pregnant women as vulnerable is not a controversial idea as accommodations are common: priority on public transit, airports, or in the ER, maternity leave, anti-discrimination laws, and workplace accommodations.

Regardless, some would argue that the child's life has moral priority over the mother's, but it cannot be definitively proven due to **moral incommensurability**. Prioritizing either the infant's or the mother's life depends on different moral frameworks with little overlap. For more information on moral incommensurability, please see [section 4](#4-support-for-alternatives-like-adoption).

Since pregnant women are demonstrably vulnerable and are owed the same moral duty of protection as the unborn, the argument for prioritizing fetal life over maternal welfare is contradictory.

### COMPLETED 5. Concerns About a "Culture of Death"

>Some anti-abortion advocates worry that allowing abortions contributes to a "culture of death" where life becomes seen as conditional or disposable. They believe that society should aim to support and protect life at all stages and that abortion undermines this commitment.
>
>This argument ties into broader concerns that legal abortion may devalue life by making it acceptable to end a life based on circumstances.

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
**Note**: For the sake of argument, "human life" in this section refers to humans after birth. This is not a universal definition. To learn more about this topic, see [section 1](#1-right-to-life-for-the-unborn).
{{< /alert >}}

It is true that societies and their systems can devaluate human lives.

For instance, warfare and its casualties have become accepted parts of modern civilization, despite their devastating human cost. The tobacco and alcohol industries remain legal and popular despite their known health risks such as cigarettes killing up to half of its users.[^12] Automobiles remain central to many societies despite the 40,000 deaths they caused in the US in 2022 alone.[^7]

By contrast, abortion procedures cannot devalue the lives of those already born. No legal framework has suggested that permitting abortion diminishes the rights or protections of living persons. Countries with legal abortion maintain robust public health metrics and mortality statistics. These societies continue to invest in life-saving initiatives, from healthcare improvements to accident prevention. The resources devoted to protecting and preserving life have not decreased with abortion legalization.

The claim that abortion access diminishes the value of existing human life lacks logical and empirical support - no demonstrable connection exists between the two.

Since measuring abortion's influence on the value of human life proves difficult, claiming a cause-effect relationship without evidence creates a False Cause fallacy. Such reasoning assumes connections without sufficient proof.

#### COMPLETED 5b. Death in Cultural Context

Some anti-abortion beliefs argue that celebrating abortions is morally wrong because it involves the death of a potential human life. However, this argument distorts both the nature of abortions and Western cultures' attitudes toward death. Abortions are not treated as celebratory events but rather as medical procedures for those in need, and the acknowledgment of death is deeply woven into Western cultural traditions.

Western society has long incorporated death into its ceremonies and traditions. Funeral rites hold profound cultural importance, while birthdays mark our journey through life until death. Death also serves as a central narrative theme in folklore and literature, appearing in the stories of legendary figures such as King Arthur, Darth Vader, Achilles, Oedipus, Socrates, and Alexander Hamilton, only to name a few.

But arguably, the most significant death in Western culture is that of Jesus Christ, whose figure and death are fundamental to Christianity. The crucifixion of Jesus is commemorated every year during  Holy Week, which includes Good Friday and Easter, by both Christians and non-Christians alike.

Beyond religion, Western societies also memorialize the deaths of its citizens through powerful symbols like monuments honoring fallen soldiers, as exemplified by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial [^8] (see figure 1).

In contrast, abortion has no associated holidays or ceremonies, rarely appears in storytelling, even in contemporary works, and those who undergo the procedure do not typically celebrate it.

Since Western cultures already celebrate death while excluding abortions, the "culture of death" argument is unsupported.
