## Terminology

This article won't mention the commonly used terms *pro-choice* and *pro-life,* as they are biased and politically framed.

Instead, these terms will be used:

- **anti-abortion**: encompasses all abortion-related beliefs considering it inherently immoral.
- **anti-anti-abortion**: encompasses all abortion-related beliefs *not* considering it inherently immoral.

## Disclaimer

This is an article proving six common anti-abortion arguments to be either fallacies, self-contradictory, or false.

This article will **only consider morality**, even if this debate is inherently political and often encompasses policy. Since policy attempts to reach a compromise while considering other factors than morality, such as economic factors, this article will not consider policy.

Despite this article leaning toward an anti-anti-abortion stance, it does not make any such moral claim, as it is beyond the scope of this essay.

This article is **not targeting or attacking** any specific individuals or beliefs. This blog is a safe and secular space for all individuals and ideas.

## Six Arguments

### 1. Right to Life for the Unborn

>The core of the anti-abortion position is the belief that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a distinct individual with a right to life. This belief is based on the idea that, from the moment of conception, the fetus has its own DNA and the potential to develop into a full-grown human.
>
>Anti-abortion advocates argue that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives.

While we can agree that society has a moral responsibility to protect human lives, the right to life hinges on a true and universal definition of life — one that remains undefined as of now.

Despite this, different anti-abortion stances follow different definitions. Common components include a completed strand of DNA and developing cells.

Some would argue that life involves more than DNA. Other crucial factors often include: the ability to reproduce, maintaining homeostasis, metabolic processes, a life-sustaining cellular structure, and reacting to stimuli. None of these definitions can be proven to be true, as each either encompasses what is obviously not life or excludes what is obviously life.

For example, the claim that life requires reproduction excludes five-year-old children who, despite this, are considered life. Another example considers frogs who can still react to electrical stimuli, despite being dead.

In regards to those points and fetuses, until the second trimester (weeks 13-26), they do not react to stimuli, are not able to maintain homeostasis, have a limited metabolism, possess a different cellular structure than children, and are not equipped with reproductive organs — not even immature ones. These are valid but inconclusive arguments against first-trimester fetuses being alive.

In regards to the original definition consisting of possessing a completed strand of DNA with developing cells, early corpses also possess these attributes, but it does not mean that corpses are alive. 

This issue of definitions is closely related to the [Sorites Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox):

>If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, the question is at what exact point it ceases to be considered a heap?

This paradox points out the blurry lines between transitional states like during a fetus' development. If a single unfertilized egg is not a human life, but a born child is, at what exact point the fetus can be considered a human life? Since there is not yet a universal definition of life, we cannot consider all fetuses to be alive. Therefore, the argument that abortion is immoral based on the premise that fetuses are alive remains currently unsubstantiated.

### 2. Religious Beliefs

>Many anti-abortion supporters hold strong religious beliefs about the sanctity of life. For them, terminating a pregnancy is viewed as morally wrong, and they believe that ending a life should only occur in extreme cases (or not at all).

When approaching a philosophical debate, it is important to remain secular. This demands prioritizing reason, empirical evidence, and human experience over religious doctrines or spiritual beliefs. But it does **not** mean disregarding or denying religion, or claiming moral superiority.

Religious texts and theology can be used in secular debates with great results, as long reason as is prioritized. But even without theological involvement, results of secular debates often align with religious beliefs, they are not incompatible.

For example Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used Christian theology to advocate for equality and justice in [Letter from Birmingham Jail](https://letterfromjail.com/):

>I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their “thus saith the Lord” far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town.

This said, claiming that abortion is wrong only by referring to biblical passages such as Exodus 20:13 "*you shall not murder*," or Psalm 139:13-16 "*for you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb*," does not constitute a valid argument as this is considered an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) and faith. Reason can be used to elaborate on those quotes, but as it stands, appeals to authority are not a valid argument.

### 3. Concern for Potential Harm to Women

>Anti-abortion advocates sometimes argue that abortion can have negative physical and emotional effects on people who undergo it. They cite studies or personal accounts of individuals who regret their abortions or experience lasting psychological impacts, like grief or guilt.

It is true that abortions have significant physically and emotionally tolls, even if most women who have an abortion are not more likely than those denied the procedure to have depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation.[^1] Abortions are also medical procedures, and all procedures include risks of complications, but research shows that safe abortions carried out using a method recommended by the World Health Organization are considered very-safe with deaths only occurring in 0.001% of cases.[^2]

Regardless of the numbers presented in those studies, the moral claim from this argument is self-contradicting because giving birth is also physically and emotionally tolling, and the risks of complications are high. The World Health Organization stated that "every day in 2020, almost 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth."[^3]

This is a comprehensive list of common mental and physical struggles women may experience during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period:

- **Mental and Emotional Struggles**

  - **During Pregnancy**
    - Anxiety and Worry
    - Depression (Perinatal Depression)
    - Mood Swings
    - Body Image and Self-Esteem Issues
    - Sleep Disruptions and Resulting Fatigue

  - **During Childbirth**
    - Fear and Anxiety about Labor and Delivery
    - Vulnerability and Emotional Sensitivity

  - **After Pregnancy (Postpartum)**
    - Postpartum Depression
    - Anxiety and Postpartum Anxiety Disorders
    - Emotional Attachment and Bonding Challenges
    - Guilt and Self-Doubt
    - Feelings of Isolation and Loneliness
    - Stress from Role Changes and Responsibilities
    - Pressure to Meet Societal or Personal Expectations

- **Physical Struggles**

  - **During Pregnancy**
    - Nausea and Vomiting (Morning Sickness)
    - Fatigue
    - Body Changes and Weight Gain
    - Back Pain and Joint Pain
    - Swelling (Edema)
    - Shortness of Breath
    - Digestive Issues (Heartburn, Constipation)
    - Varicose Veins and Hemorrhoids
    - Gestational Diabetes and High Blood Pressure
    - Sleep Discomfort

 - **During Childbirth**
    - Labor Pain and Discomfort
    - Exhaustion from Labor
    - Risk of Medical Complications

  - **After Pregnancy (Postpartum)**
    - Postpartum Recovery Pain
    - Lactation Discomfort
    - Hormonal Changes and Hair Loss
    - Fatigue and Sleep Deprivation
    - Increased Risk of Infections
    - Urinary Incontinence and Pelvic Floor Weakness
    - Diastasis Recti and Abdominal Weakness
    - Challenges with Sexual Health and Intimacy

If abortions are immoral because of the physical and mental impact on those who undergo the procedure, then giving birth is also immoral for the same reason. But since giving birth is not seen as immoral according to either anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs, this point is self-contradicting.

### 4. Support for Alternatives like Adoption

>Anti-abortion supporters often advocate for alternatives to abortion, such as adoption. They argue that choosing adoption gives the child a chance at life while also potentially fulfilling the desires of families who are unable to have children naturally.
>
>Many in the anti-abortion movement push for more support for pregnant individuals, such as better access to healthcare, social services, and other resources to help make parenting or adoption a more viable choice.

It is true that adoption gives children a chance to live potentially fulfilling lives and that families unable to conceive greatly benefit from it.

It is also well known that adoption services are underfunded and that the adoption process for qualified families is lengthy, difficult, and expensive. This difficult hurtle stops many families from adopting and orphans from being adopted. Further funding to the adoption sector could greatly improve the lives of both families and orphans.[^4]

But regardless, adoption and abortion can coexist; there is nothing stopping orphanages from existing along with abortion clinics.

There will be orphans of deceased or otherwise unavailable parents regardless of the popularity of abortions, and gynecologists can still offer abortion services regardless of the success of adoption centers.

This point is a false dilemma, and thus is invalid.

#### 4b. Choosing Between Adoption and Abortion

In regards to the moral choice of a pregnant woman contemplating both abortion and adoption, it is impossible to determine which option is the most moral.

This situation falls under the concept of **moral incommensurability**, where two options uphold different moral values. In this case, abortion promotes personal autonomy, bodily integrity, choice of reproductive right, health and well-being, and gender equality while adoption promotes the value of a potential life, family, societal contributions, and child welfare.

Since these different values do not share a common moral framework for comparison, they are considered incommensurable, and as such it is impossible to prove which is morally superior.

This dilemma is non-conclusive.

### 5. Protecting and Valuing Vulnerable Lives

>From a philosophical perspective, anti-abortion supporters often believe that society has an obligation to protect its most vulnerable members, including the unborn. This belief stems from the idea that one’s value is intrinsic and not dependent on development stage, viability, or circumstance.
>
>For anti-abortion advocates, this means treating the unborn with the same respect and care as other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or disabled.

Anti-abortion and anti-anti-abortion beliefs both agree on society's obligation to protect its most vulnerable members such as the elderly or disabled. But according to both categories of beliefs, pregnant women are also considered to be vulnerable members due to their health risks[^10], mental health concerns[^6], or economic disadvantages[^9].

Pregnant women are more susceptible to health complications such as high blood pressure (hypertension), gestational diabetes, infections, preeclampsia, preterm labor, nausea, or anemia.[^10]

Pregnancy can also contribute to mental health issues, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which affect pregnant women more than non-pregnant women (6-8% vs. 4-5%).[^6]

Pregnancy also has a significant effect on finances. A study found significant financial challenges for women during and after pregnancy[^9]:

- 24% of women reported unmet healthcare needs due to costs and 60% faced affordability concerns about medical bills and debt.
- Over half reported difficulty covering basic expenses, like housing and bills.
- Disruptions in insurance coverage postpartum increase risks of inadequate care and even privately insured women often face high out-of-pocket costs.

This comes into play when pregnant women experience medical complications requiring abortions.[^3] Such an example of a medical condition are ectopic pregnancies which occur when the fetus develops outside the uterus, such as in the fallopian tubes. When untreated, this condition can cause internal bleeding and death. In the US, 2 out of 100 pregnancies are ectopic.[^5]

Since pregnant women are vulnerable and are owed the same moral duty to be protected as the unborn, this point is self-contradictory.

### 6. Concerns About a "Culture of Death"

>Some anti-abortion advocates worry that allowing abortion contributes to a "culture of death" where life becomes seen as conditional or disposable. They believe that society should aim to support and protect life at all stages and that abortion undermines this commitment.
>
>This argument ties into broader concerns that legal abortion may devalue life by making it acceptable to end a life based on circumstances or convenience.

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
**Note**: for the sake of argument, "human life" in this section refers to humans after birth. This is by no means a universal definition, of which none exist. To learn more about this topic, see [section 1](#1-right-to-life-for-the-unborn).
{{< /alert >}}

It is true that certain societal systems or structures can lead to the devaluation of human life. For instance, war is seen as an essential part of modern civilization and is often described as "necessary evil". Other examples include popular industries like tobacco and alcohol, which contribute to long-term health risks. Cars are seen as a crucial part of many societies, yet they caused more than 40000 deaths in the US in 2022 alone. [^7]

In regards to abortion procedures, by definition, they cannot directly devalue the lives of those already born. This is evidenced in several ways: No legal framework has ever suggested that permitting abortion diminishes the rights or protections of living persons. In countries where abortion is legal, public health metrics and mortality statistics remain equally significant - deaths from accidents or diseases are not treated with less gravity. Moreover, these societies continue to invest heavily in life-saving initiatives, from healthcare improvements to accident prevention programs. The resources allocated to protecting and preserving life have not diminished with the legalization of abortion.

Therefore, the claim that abortion access somehow diminishes the value of existing human life lacks both logical and empirical support - there is simply no demonstrable connection between the two.

Since the influence of abortion on the value of human life is difficult to measure, claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without proof leads to a False Cause fallacy. Such an argument assumes a connection without sufficient evidence, making it invalid.

#### 6b. Celebrating a "Culture of Death"

Generally, abortions are not seen as enjoyable events or worthy of celebration. They are most often considered a medical procedure for those in need.

However, despite this, Western cultures already celebrate death. For example, funeral ceremonies, such as burials, are considered an important aspect of these cultures. It could also be argued that birthdays indirectly celebrate death, as they mark the time we have spent alive and stop being celebrated once we are dead.

Death is also a crucial storytelling element in folklore. Important deaths from the most significant stories and myths include King Arthur, Darth Vader, Achilles, Oedipus, Socrates, and Alexander Hamilton only to name a few.

But arguably, the most significant death in Western culture is that of Jesus Christ, the Savior of Christianity, a religion centered around His death. This event is commemorated by both Christians and non-Christians during Holy Week, which includes Good Friday and Easter.

In the United States, death of its citizens is commemorated in many ways, such as with memorials for soldiers who perished in wars[^8] (see figure 1).

![View of names etched into the granite face of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_reflection_in_low_light.jpg/1280px-Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_reflection_in_low_light.jpg "View of names etched into the granite face of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, by National Park Service - https://www.flickr.com/photos/42600860@N02/51971811478/")

Despite all these celebrations of death in culture, abortion has no such holiday. It isn't a common trope in stories, even modern ones, and abortions are often not celebrated by the people who undergo them, unlike burials.

Since we already have a culture of death, and abortion is not part of it, this point is false.
