* Getting over aspergers
I used to be so self conscious socially that I wouldn't leave my house for years at a time. I worked remote, had rice delivered to my doorstep once a month, and only went out at dark so that no one would see me. Although I got over that through a 4 steps plan:
1) Learn about who you are by reflecting and asking questions like: what you like, what you don't like, what you need, why...
2) Learn about how neurotypical people work, what they expect from all types of relationships, what do they need and want, and why
3) Figure out where the dissonance comes from in your relationships, and be accept to change yourself in order to harmonize it
4) Permanently drop the mask and self-improve through a positive cycle
