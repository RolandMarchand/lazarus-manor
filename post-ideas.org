1. Overcoming Asperger's Syndrome: I used to be so socially self-conscious that I would stay indoors for years. I worked remotely, had rice delivered monthly, and only ventured out after dark to avoid being seen. I overcame this through a four-step plan:
   1) Reflect on who you are by asking yourself questions about your likes, dislikes, needs, and reasons behind them.
   2) Understand how neurotypical people function, what they expect in relationships, and what they need and want.
   3) Identify the sources of dissonance in your relationships and be willing to change to align better with others.
   4) Remove your social mask permanently and engage in continuous self-improvement through a positive cycle.
